      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>
        In the REST world, the resource is key, and it’s really tempting to simply look at a Django model and make a direct link between resources and models – one model, one resource. This fails, though, as soon as you need to provide any sort of aggregated resource, and it really fails with highly denormalized models. Think about a Superhero model: a single GET /heros/superman/ ought to return all his vital stats along with a list of related Power objects, a list of his related Friend objects, etc. So the data associated with a resource might actually come out of a bunch of models. Think select_related(), except arbitrary. Manduma pindureta quium dia nois paga. Copo furadis é disculpa de bebadis, arcu quam euismod magna. Si num tem leite então
        bota uma pinga aí cumpadi! Paisis, filhis, espiritis santis.
